## ⚔️ Attack Explanation  
DTAAE’s attack unfolds in **3 rapid stages**, making it extremely difficult to counter or quarantine once detected:  

### 🌀 Stage 1:  
The malware marks itself a **Critical Process**, making sure that its termination triggers a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death). This mechanism also crashes the system after the destruction is complete.  

### 🚫 Stage 2:  
DTAAE denies access to the **C:** drive for all processes (excluding itself). Since DTAAE doesn’t directly access files and **C:** is merely a partition, this step ensures antivirus tools are crippled.  

### 💥 Stage 3:  
The malware clears the first **5 MB** of the disk, effectively destroying the **MBR (Master Boot Record)** or **GPT (GUID Partition Table)**. In some cases, parts of a partition may also be deleted.
> *Note: This destruction is difficult to recover from, unlike tools like MEMZ that utilize Windows installer ISOs for recovery.*
> *However, there is a concern of GPT Backup Headers which are located at the end of the disk which store the GPT headers as a backup.*

All three stages are executed within seconds, leaving minimal time for counteraction.
